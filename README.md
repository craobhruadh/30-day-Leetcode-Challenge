# 30-day-Leetcode-Challenge

In April 2020, Leetcode held a 30-day coding challenge.  This repository archives my solutions to the daily challenge. I didn't start saving my solutions until April 5th, 2020. 

This is currently ongoing, but let's see if I finish, the fancy bag they are raffling looks nice!

Update: April 30, 2020 - I did it!  I highly recommend the experience, the difficulty ramps up so it's good practice.  Leetcode is doing another one in May, I hope they keep it up.
